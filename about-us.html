      <h5>&quot;Surprisingly Impressed&quot;</h5>
      <p>
        I took a chance to order online again after potentially being scammed by
        another online clothing store called Geodolly. I ordered swimsuit,
        underwear, jewelry, wallet and fitness belt from AROMA on 7 January 2023
        and received it all today, 11 days later! I may have misjudged myself
        with the swimsuit and bra size but otherwise I'm surprisingly Impressed
        with AROMA's prompt and traceable services. It has restored my faith in
        convenient online shopping again.Thank you!

      <h5>&quot;Piss Poor Customer Support&quot;</h5>
      <p>
        AROMA is a trifling company with lying agents! 1. They don't have a
        phone # for customers to call if there's a problem with their order,
        only a bot. I finally found an email for them and was literally lied to
        about my order. Theyre forcing me to wait a full 7 days to get a refund
        after my order was marked LOST by UPS! Don't ever order from AROMA -
        wish I have listened to my sister when she said "Don't do it!"

      <h5>&quot;My great shopping experience with AROMA&quot;</h5>
      <p>
        For a long time I order from a AROMA website I can say great quality,
        good customer service, excellent evaluation and even fast shipping. The
        price is good compared to quality. The last order was on 2018/2/18 We in
        the Middle East are considered the number one shopping website, where
        there are Arab clothes and large sizes I advise you to try it
      </p>

      <h5>&quot;One of the best shopping experiences.&quot;</h5>
      <p>
        To start off, I love that they have so many choices of all kinds of
        clothing. From sweaters, tops and shoes. The price are unbelievable, at
        first I actually could believe how cheap they were. I evem compared it
        with another website and yeah, BIG differnce and better. And the FREE
        SHIPPING.

      <h3>A Brief TUNE History</h3>
      <p>
        The story of AROMA &amp;  begins in 1990 when BESTSELLER sends a young,
        fiery soul to the Oslo fashion fair with a modest, but carefully chosen
        collection aimed at young men. The reception exceeds all expectations
        and the creation of a new menswear brand is a reality. In the following
        years AROMA &amp;  manifests itself as one of the strongest jeans brands
        on the market and within a few years, the brand has several hundred
        stores. Today AROMA &amp;  is one of Europe&apos;s leading producers of
        menswear with more than one thousand stores in 38 countries and
        AROMA &amp;  clothes are sold by thousands of wholesale partners all
        over the world.
